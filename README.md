# python
working app

This is a simple app that uses openweathermap.org API to pull current weather data.
UI consists of simple search bar and Search button. 
Upon searching we can see displayed information;
  - city that was searched for
  - weather icon and description of the weather
  - temperature

App will not allow gibberish to be searched for, and instead of crashing (like before when I had bit less idea of what I'm doing),
it now displays an error of city not found and shakes the search bar. Simmilar is with searching when no entry has been made. 
Search bar shakes and error is displayed.
